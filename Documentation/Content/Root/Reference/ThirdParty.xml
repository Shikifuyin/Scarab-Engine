				Third-party module is split into several parts. The most fundamental one
				is the System sub-directory holding all platform-dependant functions and
				provides hardware abstraction for a few things needing assembler code.
				The Forwards sub-directory contains the forwards needed to hide any dependant
				header we don't want to expose. This way only the code we really need is included.
				Other sub-directories are all the APIs we need a framework for to merge with higher
				level code properly.
