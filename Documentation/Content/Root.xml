			<lang-en> This is the root of the documentation, from here you can reach anything you want information about.

				The documentation is split into several parts :
				  - Getting Started :    A quick-start overview to introduce Scarab-Engine.
				  - Coding Conventions : Directives and recommandation for good coding-practices.
				  - Basic Framework :    Empty Application skeleton to build upon.
				  - Developper Manual :  In-Depth full documentation for Scarab-Engine.
				  - Reference :          API Reference, organized by code hierarchy.

				For a good learning curve, you should begin with the 'Getting Started' and 'Basic Framework' sections to
				familiarizee yourself with basic interfaces. Then, you should look at the 'Coding Conventions' to avoid
				starting with bad habits ...
				From there, you should look at the engine's code a little, it is very well organized and you can navigate
				easily. If you find parts that catch your attention, go to the 'API Reference' and navigate just the same way
				as in the code to find detailed information. You can also lookup for related topics in the 'Developper Manual'.
				You will find naming conventions to be very self-explaining so you should be able to understand what does what
				intuitively.
				Last but not least, don't forget the forum ! This is your interactive help platfom ...
